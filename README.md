Official PyTorch implementation of [**SCONE: Surface Coverage Optimization in Unknown Environments by Volumetric Integration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10449) (NeurIPS 2022, Spotlight).

This repository currently contains:

- scripts to initialize and train models
- evaluation pipelines to reproduce quantitative results

**Note**: We will add **installation guidelines**, **training data generation scripts** and **test notebooks** as soon as possible to allow for reproducibility.

## Installation :construction_worker:

We will add more details as soon as possible.

## Download Data

### 1. ShapeNetCore

We generate training data for both occupancy probability prediction and coverage gain estimation from [ShapeNetCore v1](https://shapenet.org/). <br>
We will add the data generation scripts and corresponding instructions as soon as possible.

### 2. Custom Dataset of large 3D scenes

We conducted inference experiments in large environments using 3D meshes downloaded on the website Sketchfab under the CC license. <br>
3D models courtesy of [Brian Trepanier](https://sketchfab.com/CMBC), [Andrea Spognetta](https://sketchfab.com/spogna), and [Vr Interiors](https://sketchfab.com/vrInteriors). <br>
We will add more details as soon as possible.

## How to use :rocket:

We will add more details as soon as possible.

## Further information :books:

We adapted the code from [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains/se3-transformer-pytorch/blob/main/se3_transformer_pytorch/spherical_harmonics.py) to generate spherical harmonic features. <br>
We thank him for this very useful harmonics computation script! <br>

We also thank [Tom Monnier](https://www.tmonnier.com/) for his Markdown template, which we took inspiration from.
